# 102 Category Flower Dataset
# Overview
The 102 Category Flower Dataset consists of images from 102 flower categories commonly found in the United Kingdom. Each category contains between 40 and 258 images.

The dataset presents significant challenges due to variations in scale, pose, and lighting conditions. Additionally, some categories exhibit high intra-class variation, while others are visually very similar, making classification more difficult.

Detailed information on each category, including the number of images per class, is available on the [category statistics page].

To aid in understanding the dataset structure, it has been visualized using Isomap based on shape and color features.
